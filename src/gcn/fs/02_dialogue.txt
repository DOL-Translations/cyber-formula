00:I race by my skill alone, and this\ncheckered flag is proof of it!

01:Let's go, Asurada!\nWe'll win this race no matter what!

02:Watch out for me, Asuka..\nAsurada, we're going!

03:Today I'll show you what a real racer looks like!

04:I don't arrive on the grid\nintending to lose!

05:I didn't think I could win,\nbut I wanted to win!

06:Damn..\nIf I can't catch up, there's no hope left!

07:I haven't fully used this machine's\nfull potential!\nI need to try harder!

08:I'll do my best,\nI'm not going to lose to you guys!

09:I'm ready to go,\njust say when!

10:Um..\nI'll do my best to catch up to you,\nMr. Kazami!

11:I wish everyone would just drop out\nand retire!\nOh, you didn't hear that, did you?

12:Good luck in today's race!\n..Idiot. Enjoy the only encouragement\nyou'll get today.

13:I did it!\nI finally did it, boss!!

14:So close...\nI'll get my revenge in the next race!

15:Damn it!\nIf only they hadn't gotten in my way,\nI would have won!

16:I'm all set and raring to go...\nAll that's left is to grab that win!

17:If you don't throw everything you\ncherish away, you won't grab a single\nspeck of glory!

18:Winning is everything in a race..\nIf you lose, life's got nothing\nleft for ya!

19:I'm taking my future and glory into my\nown hands, and I'm not afraid to shove\nanyone who gets in my way!

20:Don't worry about me,\nI've got my eyes on the prize and I know the risks..

21:Everything's falling into place.\nFate picked me, and I'll decide my own\npath from here.

22:Huff, huff, huff...\nI-I'm sorry!\nI'll fix things next time, I promise!

23:Even after losing it all..\nIs it still not enough?

24:You can't afford to lose?\nWell me neither!!

25:Alright, then,\nhere I go!!

26:I'll do my absolute best!\nLet's give it our all!!

27:Don't run away!\nThe battle's just getting started!!

28:Looking good over there!\nI think I might just take you on!!

29:Hey, a driver's gotta drive! It's the results that matter!

30:You really are something, aren't you, jerk?!

31:What's done is done.\nWe need to focus on the next race!

32:I believe in the races I've won!

33:I can't afford to lose!\nI'll win this race for sure!

34:The quality of the machine doesn't matter!\nA professional racer like me will drive no\nmatter what the conditions!!

35:I'll leave you in the dust!

36:I won't hold back. Understand?

37:A great performance!\nIf I race, I always have to win!!

38:...Damn it!\nI shouldn't be a driver if I can't win!!

39:What am I even doing?!\nTo think my big words were so pointless\nin getting results!

40:I'll drive my machine to perfection!\nAfter all, I designed it myself.\nNo blind spots here, that's for sure!

41:I'll prove the superiority of my designs.\n...Let's see what you've got!

42:The winner?\nDon't waste your time checking.\nOf course it's me!

43:..I should be taking my leave now.\nThank you.

44:I won't accept defeat!

45:Winning this race will prove that I am\nthe best, both on the track and in\nthe workshop!

46:I never imagined it would end like this..\nWhat a disgrace!\nI need to revise my designs immediately!

47:I know this machine inside out,\nand still, this is the result!\nHow utterly disappointing!

48:A-woo!\nI can lend you a hand, little lady!\nJust holler if ya need somethin'!

49:A-woo!\nLooks like you're in a bit of a bind!\nNeed a hand?

50:Let's wrap this up quick so I can spend\nsome quality with this cutie over here!

51:Boss, you're on fire!\nJust don't overdo it or you might not make\nit to the finish line.

52:Whoa there!\nThanks for the tip, pardner!

53:Had myself in a bit of a rodeo out there, huh!

54:Heinel, if you can't get my Stallion up\nto speed, then this cowboy might have a\ntough time winning!

55:Ah!?\nWhere are y'all headin' off to,\nmy lovely ladies!?

56:I've reached the pinnacle of every sport!\nThere's no way I can lose now, surely.

57:Let's make race a memorable one!\nGo Issuxark!

58:Prepare to witness why they call me a\nchild prodigy!

59:This victory is dedicated to you, Mother and Father!

60:Hmph,\nnever underestimate the Randoll family!

61:Did you witness it, Father and Mother?\nAs a Randoll, Karl has achieved a result\nthat befits our name.

62:Damn it,\nI hope that fortunate break wasn't just\na fluke...

63:This is inconceivable..\nIt can't end like this!\nI'm going home.

64:I guess I'm a veteran now..\nWell then, I guess I'll show you what\nveteran driving's all about!

65:My blood boils at the sound of every race.\nI guess I am a racer, through and through.

66:I'll win this race if it kills me..\nLet's go!

67:Hmph,\njust having speed alone won't win\nthe race!

68:Hey, kids...\nJust to be clear, I won't be giving you\nany easy breaks!

69:Haha,\nI'm overwhelmed with emotion!\nGuess I still got it!

70:Phew..\nI guess I should be happy I made it this far.\nStill, next time will be different!

71:Damn it!\nIs it possible I'm already past my prime?

72:Huh, me?

73:I'm good,\nI'm not losing to anyone!

74:Alright, let's get this going!\nI'm ready to roll!!

75:I won't lose!\nGet ready,\nI'll take you on!!

76:Heh,\nI'll show you a thing or two!\nBring it on!!

77:How's that?\nYou're just getting a taste of what\nI can do when I focus!

78:This isn't...a joke!\nI'm not racing just to get passed!!

79:Huh?\nNo way...

80:I've worked so hard...\nI'm going to make every effort count!

81:Please stop treating me like a little girl\non the circuit.\nHere I go!!

82:Don't underestimate my skills just because\nI'm a woman!\nHere I go!!

83:Hehe...\nApologies if the girl's\nyour opponent!

84:You've got courage!\nDon't think you can take me lightly just\nbecause I'm a lady!

85:I did it!!\nBeing a woman doesn't hold me back,\nhard work leads to success!

86:Ha!\nI'll keep challenging until I cross that\ncheckered flag first!

87:Damn...this isn't a game!!\nI won't be defeated by anyone!

88:Righto.

89:Leave it to me, mate.

90:Here I go!

91:Looking forward to today!\nI'll be watching your driving closely.

92:Oh,\nyou're my opponent?\nLet's have a ripper race today.

93:Crikey, I did it!\nCan't believe I've won!

94:Guh..!\nNext time, I'm definitely taking the win.

95:What the..!\nSigh..\nLooks like we need a good chat with the crew.

96:Alright, leave it to me!

97:Let's get this done!

98:Go, Go, GO!!

99:All set!

100:Sorry, but this race is mine!

101:Ja!\nHow was that?

102:Grr..\nDidn't quite make the cut.

103:Ahh- no good!

104:Alright, I'm going in!

105:On standby, we're moving out!

106:Heh heh.. all set!

107:Humph!\nYou're wide open!

108:A rookie like you isn't\neven worth my time!

109:Da,\nnailed it!\n..Heh heh...

110:Tch!\nDon't think you can escape me!

111:Grr..no way?!\nWhere did I slip up..

112:This victory's mine, mate!\nLet's go!

113:Time to claim the win!

114:I'm not gonna lose, not today!

126:So close to the trophy..\nAlmost had it..\n

127:Sigh..\nDid I not push hard enough?

128:I have to win this race by myself!\nLet's hit the track!

129:I'll show you what it means to be a professional racer!

130:I'll show you my true skills\nas a Cyber Formula driver!

131:I'm not going to fall for\nyour dumb tricks again!

132:Looking forward to today.\nSee you on the grid!

133:I did it!\nAll of this tough training really paid off!

134:Damn it!\nI had plenty of chances!

135:Sorry,\nit's all my fault this happened..

136:Alright,\nI'm heading out!

149:Yes!\I've finally proved my true strength!!

150:This wasn't how it was supposed to go..\nDid all those little mistakes catch\nup to me?

151:No way!!\n...I'm better than this!

152:Alright, let's get this show on the road!

153:I'm heading out now!

154:Here I go!!

155:If you're my target,\nI'm giving it everything I've got!

156:So you're the target?\nLet's have a fair fight!

157:Phew, looks like I pulled it off!\nHard work always pays off.

158:Just fell short..\nIf only I'd pushed the machine's\nperformance further!

159:I might have been too cautious.\nLet's give it our all next time!

160:First place is mine..\nLet's go!!

161:Leave it to me.

162:I'm going for it!

163:No one can stop me!

164:I won't let anyone pass!

165:Here I come!!

166:Ugh!\n..I let my guard down.

167:No way?!\n..Ugh!

232:My Garland is simply marvelous.\nI effortlessly glide past other machines.

233:Oh my, this looks fun!\nJust in case, I made a few... adjustments.

234:I've never driven over 30 kilometers per\nhour before...\nBut today, I'll push a bit further.

235:Oh dear, it's been such a long time since\nI've driven.\nI do hope I can manage well.

236:Ah, you're racing today as well?\nHow delightful!\nLet's have a splendid race.

237:What? I've won?\nGoodness, I never imagined...\nIs it alright for me to claim victory?

238:The first-place driver was\nsimply splendid!\nThough I didn't win, I'm quite pleased.

239:Oh no, how dreadful!\nCould it be that my Garland isn't up\nto the task?

240:I'll show you the harsh realities of being\na pro driver...

241:I'm heading out!

242:Even I have a bit of driver in me...

243:You don’t really understand what\na true race is!\n...Ahahaha, just kidding!

244:Hahaha, don’t get so worked up!

245:Hahaha, give and take is the basic rule!

246:There’s no excuse for defeat.\nEndurance is also part of the fight...!

247:What!? Why...\nWhy am I losing...!?

248:Ah, well, how do you do?\nNice to meet you, I am Kyoshiro Nagumo.

249:Heh heh heh..\nI will win, no doubt about it

250:Understood, I don't mind at all.\nAfter all, it's thanks to your generosity\nthat I can race like this.

251:Oh?\nWe meet in a rather unusual place,\ndon't we?

252:Hmph..\nIf you're going to face me,\nface me head on!

253:Oh my, this is stunning..\nI feel like a movie star!

254:Results are everything, you see.\nJust trying without results means nothing.

255:Your thinking is still too naive,\nif you're actually trying to win!

256:Watch me, "Queen Aoi,"\nI'll definitly bring home a trophy,\nthe biggest one you'd like!

257:I'm done being called\n"Aoi's Young Warrior!"

258:Watch me..\nI will win, no matter what!!

259:You will be left in the dust!!

260:I won't hold back, got it?!

261:It's common sense that the fastest\ndriver always wins.\And that driver is me!

262:No, this isn't how it's done!\nKazami's driving was on a whole\ndifferent level!!

263:It's okay if you're mad, Boss..\nBecause I will never be able to drive like Kazami..

264:I'll do things my own way!

265:Alright,\nlet's get going!

266:What lies beyond Zero, is Zero itself!!

267:Wether you understand or not..\nI'm going to go for it!!

268:Honestly, I'm scared too..\nBut, I've got to deal with my monsters!

269:Huff, huff..\nHehe, I've got the checkered flag\nwithin reach!!

270:Why..?\nWhy am I losing to that guy..!

271:I just need to try again..\nNo matter how many times!

272:I believe in the machine Dad built!\nLet's go Asurada!

273:Who do you think I am?\nThe century’s genius racer, Hayato Kazami!\nAs always, I’ll be aiming for the victory!

274:Leave it to me!\nLet's go, Asurada!

275:Go for broke, let's go!!

276:I'm definitely going to win!\nJust watch!

277:I did it!\nAsuka, were you watching?\nHehe... I won!!

278:I'm defeated.\nI can't match that kind of driving..

279:I-I’m not wrong!\nUgh...Waaahhh!!

280:Asurada, we will win this race no\nmatter what!\nLet's go!!

281:I'm counting on you, Asurada!!

282:I believe in the machine Dad built!\nLet's go Asurada!

283:It doesn't matter who I'm racing,\nI won't lose!

284:Everyone else looks so confident..\nI need to believe in myself too!

285:Asuka, were you watching?\nHeh heh, I'm the champion!

286:I guess it wasn't too bad..\nBut next time, I'll win!

287:Damn it!\nI've had plenty of chances!

288:I race by my skill alone, and this\ncheckered flag is proof of it!

289:Asurada, we will win this race no\nmatter what!\nLet's go!!

290:I'm counting on you, Asurada!!

291:Asurada and I aren't just going to\nlet you win!

292:It doesn't matter who I'm racing,\nI won't lose!

293:Thank you, Asurada, for that great race!

294:Damn it!\nI've had plenty of chances!

295:I don't arrive on the grid\nintending to lose!v

296:Alright!\nLeave it all to me,\nI’ve got this covered!!

297:Even I can become a champion when I'm\nserious, let’s show them what it means to\nbe truly committed!!

298:Let’s finish this quickly,\nso I can kick back and relax\nwith the ladies!

299:Huh?\nI've seen that face before!\nHi there, how's it going?

300:Come on, come over here!\n......\nOh? Feeling shy, are we?

301:Alright, victory is ours!\nLet’s have a big celebration tonight!!

302:Oh no!?\n...Well,\nthat’s quite the mess!

303:Ugh...this is a real hassle,\nI’ve got to deal with Heinel’s\nscolding again...

304:I’ve made it onto my dream team,\nI’ll definitely prove my worth!!

305:With this machine, I can definitely win..!\nNo one’s calling me the\n“Queen of Retirements” anymore!!

306:I’ve worked so hard to get here...\nI’m going to win for sure!

307:So you're my opponent?\nHeh, if you think I’m the same as before,\nyou’re in for a shock!!

308:Oh my,\nI wonder what kind of competitor\nI'm up against...

309:Sniff...I did it!\nI-I’m not crying or anything!

310:Oh, so close...\nI was almost there!

311:Losing with the latest machine...!\nBut I won’t be discouraged,\nI’ll win next time for sure!!

312:I can't keep looking up to\nMr. Kazami forever..\nI need to step up, too!

313:I’m a former World Champion, too.\nThis race isn’t one I can’t win!

314:The condition of the machine and\nmyself are perfect.\nAll that’s left is to win this race!

315:Maybe I’ll drive seriously this time...\nHeh heh heh..\nI’m sure I’ll win even if I don't!

316:You think you can beat me?\nNot a chance!\nHeh heh heh...

317:Dad, did you see?\nI...won the championship!

318:Ugh...\nI’m so frustrated!\nIf only I could drive like Mr. Kazami...

319:I lost...?\nHow could have this have happened!!

320:This is an opportunity I've been given.\nI'll make sure to give it my all!\nNemesis, lend me your strength!

321:What? I get to race?!\nI'll do it!\nPlease believe it me!!

322:I can't believe I'm standing here,\nit's unbelievable!\nAlright, let's do our best, Nemesis!!

323:Um..hello..\nI'm Shiba!\nI look forward to racing with you today!

324:Um..\nbeing able to race with all of you..\nis an honor!!

325:I won..\nI can't believe it!\nThank you Nemesis,\nI couldn't have done it without you!!

326:I should be happy with the results,\nbut I know I could have pushed harder!\nI have to do better!

327:If I can take full advantage over\nNemesis' performance,\nI can bring out the best in both of us!

328:Huh? I'm going to be in the race?\nIsn't like that like,\nultra-super-amazingly-awesome!?

329:This is as big an opportunity as becoming\na campaign girl, right? Hehe, maybe my\nentry into showbiz is a close tool?

330:Alright, let's do this!\nLet's give t our best, Nemesis!!

331:Um, I'm Rena Yuki,\nMs. Shiba's childhood friend.\nPlease don't be too rough!

332:Oh, everyone looks so tough!\nBut is there anyone who can beat\nMiss Rena driving Nemesis? Hehehe!

333:Daily practice really does pay off!\nYep, yep!

334:What?! How?!\nNo, I wanted to be in first!!\n..Hmph, this is boring.

335:Ah..hahaha..\nYou know, my main job is a campaign girl..\nYou got a problem with that?
